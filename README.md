# gigs/stata-journal: 

## About
We plan to publish outputs from the Guidance for 
International Growth Standards (GIGS) project, including in
the Stata Journal. This repository contains do-files and 
their outputs, which are necessary for writing the Examples 
portion of a SJ manuscript.

## Installing `gigs-stata`
You can install `gigs-stata` from GitHub using the 
[`github`](https://haghish.github.io/github/) module for Stata:
```stata
. github install lshtm-gigs/gigs-stata
```

Or you can install it directly from SSC using `net install`:
```stata
. net install gigs
```

You may then run the `gigs_examples.do` file to generate the 
outputs found in `gigs_examples.log.tex`.
