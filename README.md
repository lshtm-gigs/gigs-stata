This package provides a unified interface to WHO Growth Standards data as well as growth information from the 
INTERGROWTH-21st project. In this package you will find functions for converting between anthropometric measures (e.g. 
weight or length) to z-scores and percentiles, and the inverse. Also included are functions for classifying newborn 
growth according to DHS guidelines.
