d gigs provides a single, simple interface for working with outputs from the INTERGROWTH-21st project and the WHO Child Growth standards. You will find functions for converting between anthropometric measures (e.g. weight or length) to z-scores and centiles, and the inverse. Also included are functions for classifying newborn and infant growth according to DHS guidelines.
